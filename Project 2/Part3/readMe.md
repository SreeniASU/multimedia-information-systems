How to use:
run the program from command line:
python main.py

This program will quantize a file of the form X_Y.tpc or X_Y.spc and output a new quantized file X_Y_0.tpq/spq or X_Y_M.tpq/spq
where 'M' is the number of bins selected for quantization. 
To begin input the directory of the files to be operated on, then follow the console directions.
